    "This is a vectorized version of the environment. How does it work? Simply put, instead of running a single environment, we're running them into batches (vectorization). At each time step, instead of formulating a single action $a$, we'll define it as a vector $a=[0, .., n_\\text{envs}]$ where each entry corresponds to the action to be performed for an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if you run 4 simulatenous environments, your observations space becomes (4, num_observations). Because we use a step size of 10 and have a total of 9 snesors, each observation will result into a space of (40,9) elements. The core idea is to speed up the inference and training time of the model instead of querying a single environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, based on what model you decide, you should take as inputs the observations reshaped to your liking, and predict the actions $a$ from your policy."
